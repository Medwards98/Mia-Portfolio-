<h1> Hi my name is Mia and welcome to my digital CV!</h1> 
<h2><u>Education</u></h2>
<p> -I am currently completing a BA in history at the University of Sheffield and for my first year I achieved a high 2.1 degree class. While I understand that this degree is not relevant for a position within the tech industry, my passion for computer science and technology has only increased since coming to university and making friends with those who do programming as part of their degree course. I have sat in on Physics lectures about coding with python, asked for my friends who study Computer Science to evaluate my code and have continued to teach myself programming and theory, such as Boolean algebra and data structures, in my spare time. </p>
<p> - I am currently involved in the Sheffield mentoring scheme which pairs university students with ex-alumni who work in a sector they are interested in pursuing. My mentor has worked within the technology sector for over twenty years and is currently involved in the implementation of Office 365. </p>
 <p> - I am also going into the Manchester based software development company Dreamr in November to learn about their operations and receive some guidance in pursuing a career within technology. </p><div>
 -I have completed a number of courses on Code Academy and Udemy which focus upon the following languages, as I am interested in both front-end web development and software development:
<p>- HTML</p>
<p>- CSS</p>
<p>- Python</p>
<p>- Java Script </p></div>

<div><h2><u>Work Experience and Volunteering</u></h2></div>
<p><strong>Oxfam (2015-2016)</p></strong>
<p>. Worked in a shop environment where I learned customer service skills, how to order items for sale and work a till.</p>
<p><strong>International Student Club (Summer 2015, 2016, 2018)</strong></p> 
<p>. My role as an Activity Monitor meant that I had to be in charge of international children from the ages of 9-18, ensuring their safety and mental wellbeing when they were so far away from their parents and home country.</p>
<p>.I would have to be available for the children at all times of the day when we were on site and make sure they had fun whatever we were doing, whether that was playing Badminton with a child who didn’t have a partner or getting the shy children to play drama games in the evening.</p>
<p>.I would also lead children on trips, which meant that I had to ensure the safety of large groups (up to around fifty-five on occasions) when crossing roads or walking in busy areas such as around Buckingham Palace. I also had to project my voice to these large groups while giving the tour.</p> 
<p>. Pastorally, any queries the children or their group leaders had would be responded to in a calm and friendly manner, working as part of a team or on my own to ensure any spontaneous issues were dealt with. It was always important to remain flexible to ensure the children in my care were happy and looked after.</p>
<div><strong>Avalon (September-November 2016)</strong></div>
<p>. I worked as an administrative assistant at Avalon, a funeral planning company, where I had to input admin data at a fast speed and create ‘funeral packs’ which contained all the necessary information customers needed about their plans.</p>
<div><strong>John Lewis</strong></div>
<p>. I worked as a selling assistant in their technical department where I sold laptops, cameras, TVs, audio equipment, phones etc. I had to learn the specifics and differences of a large range of items, with my specialty being laptops and computers, to ensure that I could cater my selling pitch around a specific customer type. My knowledge had to be to a high standard so that I could efficiently answer any technically advanced questions customers might have about the capabilities of certain products.</p>
<p>.John Lewis prides themselves on staff flexibility, so I also helped other members of staff complete tasks which weren’t necessarily in my job description, such as helping a gentleman who couldn’t work out how to use his Cannon camera or helping  the technical support team with any technical questions or issues that customers might have had with their products.</p>
<p>.I also had to be adept at solving customer problems over the phone, while still being active on the shop floor. Such issues could include TV instillation problems, complaints against the store or a general technology confusion questions which meant my product knowledge and understanding of the John Lewis internal systems and procedures had to be to a high standard.</p>
<div><strong>Elizabeth Gaskell's House</strong></div>
<p>. I have also volunteered at Elizabeth Gaskell’s House, a Manchester based museum, where I was involved with their social media presence, using websites such as Hootsuite to manage their Instagram and twitter feeds. I also wrote for their blog about my time working there and researched about Elizabeth Gaskell, the items displayed in the museum and the people that stayed at her house.</p>
