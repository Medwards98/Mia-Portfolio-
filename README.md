<div><h2><u>Work Experience</u></h2></div>
<p><strong>International Student Club (Summer 2015, 2016, 2018)</strong></p> 
<p>. My role as an Activity Monitor meant that I had to be in charge of international children from the ages of 9-18, ensuring their safety and mental wellbeing when they were so far away from their parents and home country.</p>
<p>.I would have to be available for the children at all times of the day when we were on site and make sure they had fun whatever we were doing, whether that was playing Badminton with a child who didn’t have a partner or getting the shy children to play drama games in the evening.</p>
<p>.I would also lead children on trips, which meant that I had to ensure the safety of large groups (up to around fifty-five on occasions) when crossing roads or walking in busy areas such as around Buckingham Palace. I also had to project my voice to these large groups while giving the tour.</p> 
<p>. Pastorally, any queries the children or their group leaders had would be responded to in a calm and friendly manner, working as part of a team or on my own to ensure any spontaneous issues were dealt with. It was always important to remain flexible to ensure the children in my care were happy and looked after.</p>
<div><strong>Avalon (September-November 2016)</strong></div>
<p>. I worked as an administrative assistant at Avalon, a funeral planning company, where I had to input admin data at a fast speed and create ‘funeral packs’ which contained all the necessary information customers needed about their plans.</p>
<div><strong>John Lewis</strong></div>
<p>. I worked as a selling assistant in their technical department, selling laptops, cameras, TVs, audio equipment, phones etc. I had to learn a great deal of information about products that I wasn’t previously familiar with, to ensure that I could sell them to a high standard and cater my selling pitch around the specific customer type. </p>
<p>.John Lewis prides themselves on staff flexibility, so I also helped other members of staff complete tasks which weren’t necessarily in my job description, such as helping a gentleman who couldn’t work out how to use his Cannon camera, something which would usually be dealt with by the John Lewis technical repair team rather than a selling assistant.</p>
<p>.I also had to be adept at solving customer problems over the phone, while still being active on the shop floor. Such issues could include TV instillation problems, complaints against the store or general technology confusion or issues which meant my product knowledge and understanding of the John Lewis internal systems and procedures had to be high enough to help.</p>
<div><strong><u><h2>Volunteering</h2></u></strong></div>
<p><strong>Oxfam (2015-2016)</p></strong>
<p>. Worked in a shop environment where I learned customer service skills, how to order items for sale and work a till.</p>
